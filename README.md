## Purpose

I'm passionate about the intersection between technology and business.
I have professional experience as an IT Support Analyst, working closely with systems, users, and technical operations.
I hold a degree in Information Technology for Business from FATEC, where I strengthened my understanding of how technology drives real-world business solutions.
As a GitHub Campus Expert and member of the Aspire Leaders Program, I am developing leadership skills and creating social impact within my communities. I also have experience in software development, contributing to both web and mobile projects.

I'm the organizer of (Tech Day Conference)[https://www.techdayconference.com.br], a community-driven technology event that brings together professionals, students, and opportunities to strengthen our regional tech ecosystem.
My main goal is to positively impact our society and the technology community.
